# Enable verbose Playwright debugging (0 = off, 1 = on)

# The WebSocket URL that the Go API will use to connect to this browser
# Default: ws://localhost:9222 (works when browser and API are on the same network)
# If you expose the browser on a different host/port, update this value
PLAYWRIGHT_CDP_URL=ws://localhost:9222

# Playwright driver version for the Go library
# This should match the version of the playwright-community/playwright-go module
# Check go.mod for the exact version being used
PLAYWRIGHT_DRIVER_VERSION=1.52.0

# Note: The browser container now publishes port 9222 to the host,
# so you can connect from a locally-running API using ws://localhost:9222

# If you need to run Chromium behind a proxy, set it here:
# HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128
# HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128

# Any custom configuration your app might require can be added
# here, e.g.:
# SOME_CUSTOM_FLAG=true
